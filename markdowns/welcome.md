# Prerequisites

I am assuming you are familiar with minimax (negamax) algorithm, preferably with alpha-beta pruning and optionally with iterative deepening, transposition tables etc. Also, you should know how Monte Carlo Tree Seach works, as algorithm I will present will mostly resemble MCTS with [early playout termination](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-27992-3_2).

# Introduction

Recently I've been playing with neural networks to improve the evaluation function of the minimax. Oware is quite NN-friendly

This Basic template lets you get started quickly with a simple working example. If it is your first contribution then you should have a look at the [Getting Started](https://tech.io/doc/getting-started-create-playground) document.


Please refer to the [documentation](https://tech.io/doc) to learn more about adding programming exercises within your contribution.
